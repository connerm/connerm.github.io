[{"categories":["Technology"],"content":"I am designing this blog to make it as easy a possible for me to get writing. I am trying to remove the little hurdles, so I can focus on writing and not get blogged down in code, or endlessly tweak settings. I started writing the blog in Markdown, which is easy enough to understand, but still feels like writing code. I do most of my development work in Visual Studio Code, which is an excellent editor and is the best development environment on Windows in conjunction with Windows Subsystem Linux. But one thing VS Code lacks (without using an add-on) is a spell checker. With these two issues in mind, I started looking for alternative ways I could setup my writing workflow. I found there are a number of Markdown editors available and I downloaded one to try. While it seemed to work fine, I didn’t want to have to another piece of software installed on each of my computers. I’m sure there are good Markdown editors out there, but I want to use the tools I already have at my disposal. Whether this is the right approach is hard to say; I’m testing what works for me. I next checked if Microsoft Word can natively save to Markdown. It can not. But a search revealed there is a good open source document converter: Pandoc. Pandoc can convert a huge number of document file formats, and is cross-platform. It has a number of qualities I look for when evaluating software: It’s open source, freely available It’s been around a while, but is currently supported and has a good community It has good documentation and examples I did a quick install and test run. All seemed well. I wrote this article in Word and used Pandoc to convert it to Markdown with the following command: pandoc -s website-architecture.docx -o website-architecture.md My article workflow is now: Write the blog post in Word (or Google Docs or Pages exporting to .docx when not on Windows) Convert to Markdown with Pandoc Generate a post with Hugo Append the article Markdown to the Hugo post Preview the post on the local Hugo server Publish post by generating the static content with Hugo then pushing it to the GitHub repository Well, that isn’t exactly the frictionless setup I was aiming for, but it does have its benefits. I can write a blog post anywhere with Word or another .docx compatible word processor. I can easily store all my posts in Word, Markdown, and HTML; which all are useful in their own way. And I found a new neat utility. The downside is I will have to go through this lengthy conversion process for every edit – no quick WYSIWYG fix. I will need to be careful my post are well edited before leaving Word. I think I will be able to tighten up the process a bit as well. I am aware that this is what I was trying to avoid at the outset of this endeavour. The reliability and extensibility of Pandoc to work with the conversions I throw at it is another unknown factor. Anyhow, it’s been interesting to figure out and time will tell how it works.

There is no back end server to process or store information. This limits the scope of what is possible here, but affords simplicity and security. It is hosted on Github Pages, as a user page. Github allows users to host a static website for their user profile. The site is automatically hosted when the user creates a repository named as their username, followed by github.io (i.e. connerm.github.io). Maintaining static files is tedious, so I am using the static site generator, Hugo, to manage this website. Hugo allows me to manage the contents of the blog in Markdown, an easy to read mark-up language. It also provides a local test environment, themes, and many more features than I will not delve into here. The Hugo theme which I am using is LoveIt, which accounts for all of the layout and design of the website. This is a simple list of the technologies I have used to setup this website.
