[{"categories":null,"content":"This blog is a static website, meaning it is made only of simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt files. There is no back end server to process or store information. This limits the scope of what is possible here, but affords simplicity and security. It is hosted on Github Pages, as a user page. Github allows users to host a static website for their user profile. The site is automatically hosted when the user creates a repository named as their username, followed by github.io (i.e. connerm.github.io). Maintaining static files is tedious, so I am using the static site generator, Hugo, to manage this website. Hugo allows me to manage the contents of the blog in Markdown, an easy to read mark-up language. It also provides a local test environment, themes, and many more features than I will not delve into here. The Hugo theme which I am using is LoveIt, which accounts for all of the layout and design of the website. This is a simple list of the technologies I have used to setup this website. If you are interested in setting one up for yourself, here are the resources I used when starting mine: https://guides.github.com/features/pages/ https://gohugo.io/documentation/ https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ https://hugoloveit.com/categories/documentation/ Take care, Conner ","date":"2020-06-04","objectID":"/website-architecture/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Website Architecture","uri":"/website-architecture/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hello, this is the first post on my blog.
